# shellypy2
not to be confused with [pyShelly](https://github.com/StyraHem/pyShelly)  
Python 3 Wrapper around the Shelly HTTP api forked from the 
original [ShellyPy](https://pypi.org/project/ShellyPy/) project 
that seems to be dead or at least sleeping at the moment.


## why
other packages like [pyShelly](https://github.com/StyraHem/pyShelly) 
only support CoAP or MSQT, neither I am comfortable using in personal projects


## examples
#### relay
a simple working example for the Shelly 1 that turns a relay on

```python
import shellypy

device = shellypy.Shelly("192.168.0.5")

device.relay(0, turn=True)
```
[examples/toggle_relay.py](examples/toggle_relay.py)

#### monitor
a simple working example for the Shelly 1 that request monitor information

```python
import shellypy

device = shellypy.Shelly("192.168.68.121")

deviceMeter = device.meter(0)  # request meter information
print(deviceMeter['power'])  # print power information
print(deviceMeter['total'])  # print total information
```
other examples are available as well [examples/meter.py](examples/meter.py)

best results
